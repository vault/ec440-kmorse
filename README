A linux kernel module for the raspberry pi that blinks in morse code the
message written to it.

This was a homework assignment. The message folder turns into a kernel
module that look like /dev/message0. You can write a message to it and read
it back out later. The morse folder turns into a module that implements
a morse code. You write to /dev/morse0 and (assuming this is running on
a raspberry pi, and is connected to an LED on GPIO 17) will blink out your
message in morse code.
